# Maps of the Technical Writing

In the book [Maps of the Imagination: the Writer as Cartographer](https://www.amazon.com/Maps-Imagination-Writer-as-Cartographer/dp/1595340416) Peter Turchi draws parallelism between maps and the work of a cartographer to that of a writer.

### Chapter 1 - Metaphor: or, the map

> The writer is an explorer. Every step is an advance into new land.
>
> _Ralph Waldo Emerson_

- "maps suggest explanations" "they also inspire us to ask more questions, consider other possibilities"
- "writing" => "two separate acts"
  - "exploration": "assertive action in the face of uncertain assumptions"
  - "presentation": "we create a document meant to communicate with, and have an effect on, others"
  - from "explorer" to "guide"
- "Artistic creation is a voyage into the unknown" "we are off the map"
  - "We might set out intending simply to describe what we see" "but even then we describe what _we_ see, the way we see it".
  - What is the intention of our writing?
  - "An explorer means to explorer _something_"
  - "experience reminds us that theres often a world of difference between what we hope to find, or think we might find, and what we discover"
  - "we find the story not _despite_ failed efforts to find the story but _through_ those efforts" "withouth our false stats, we would have gotten nowhere at all"
- "Having 'the technique'-the means, or ability, to go from here to there-is always, and has always been, the issue"
- "We appreciate not to having to stumble through vast forests or search for passage accross every river; but the blazed trail quickly becomes a well-worn path, one from which most of the sights have already been seen" _How to find the balance between being guided and going on our own adventures and discoveries?_ "We want to be guided, but only when we _want_ to be guided"
- "The writer's obligation is to make rewarding both the reader's journey _and_ his destination"
- "Writing" "requires us to assume authority over our creations, to assert our knowledge an talent; yet it also requires humility, a recognition that htere's always more to learn"
  - "Every writer, especially every writer who teaches, is asked for directions; and to the extent that he offers them, he takes on the role of a guide in another way, outsie of his work"
