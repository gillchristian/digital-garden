# Maps of the Codebase

![Maps of the Imagination cover](./static/maps-of-the-imagination.jpg)

_Inspired on Alvaro Videla ([@old_sound](https://twitter.com/old_sound)) essays and talks where he brings ideas from the literature world into that of software._

In the book [Maps of the Imagination: the Writer as Cartographer](https://www.amazon.com/Maps-Imagination-Writer-as-Cartographer/dp/1595340416) Peter Turchi draws parallelism between maps and the work of a cartographer to that of a writer.

## The metaphor

Maps are a representation of our world, or at least of a part of it. A representation that can never be fully accurate, if someone wanted to achieve that they would have to make a 1:1 copy of what they are trying to map.

The documentation of a codebase will never be the source of truth, the source of truth is the codebase itself. The closer we keep our documentation to the codebase, be it code comments or markdown/text files together with the code, the higher chances of maintaining consistency. Yet still the source of truth is the codebase not the documentation. However one cannot expect others or the future self to read a codebase, specially if unknown to the reader in order to figure out how it works.

Documentation is then a map to a codebase. A map helps us discover, a map _suggests explanations_, a map _inspire us to ask more questions, consider other possibilites_.

One cannot expect to map the unknown. To map we need first to explore. First we take the role of an _explorer_ and then that of a _presenter_.

...

> The writer’s obligation is to make rewarding both the reader’s journey **and** his destination

...

_Writing_

> requires us to assume authority over our creations, to assert our knowledge an talent; yet it also requires humility, a recognition that there’s always more to learn

> Every writer, especially every writer who teaches, is asked for directions; and to the extent that he offers them, he takes on the role of a guide in another way, outsie of his work

When we write documenation we are giving directions on how to navigate, interact, and use a codebase.
