# gillchristian's Digital Garden 🌱

> This is my digital garden. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

This is the corner of the internet where I share my learnings.

It is a garden, my garden.

As I plant seeds of ideas here and there. As I tend and care for those ideas. As they grow and develop. The garden of knowledge takes shape. A shape that is constantly changing and evolving.

## Why a Digital Garden?

> These are the principles for the development of a complete mind:
> study the science of art, study the art of science.
> Realize that everything connects to everything else.

> _Da Vinci_

## What can you find in this garden?

I am but a beginner gardener. I haven't yet mastered the art of digital gardening. That will take quite some time.

I started cultivating the garden recently. Only the very first 🌱 Seedlings are planted. But with time those will grow into 🌿 Buddings and eventually, with the right amount of time and care, some will become 🌳 Evergreens[^maggie].

[^maggie]: I got the idea of categorizing by 🌱 Seedling, 🌿 Budding and 🌳 Evergreen from [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/). I discovered digital gardens from her tweets. She's got an [amazing digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden).
