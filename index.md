# gillchristian's Digital Garden 🌱

> This is my digital garden. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

This is the corner of the internet where I share my learnings.

It is a garden, my garden.

As I plant seeds of ideas here and there. As I tend and care for those ideas. As they grow and develop. The garden of knowledge takes shape. A shape that is constantly changing and evolving.
