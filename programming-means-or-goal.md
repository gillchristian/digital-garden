# Programming, means to an end or the end on itself?

First we have to define programming.

...

I think there are two types of programmers, those that do it as a mean to achieve something else and those that view programming as the end on itself. And then many flavors of that in between. So it’s more of an spectrum than a binary distinction.

## Programming as a means to an end

People that only use programming as a tool are usually focused on solving an specific non programming related problem. Tracking their habits, keeping an inventory of stock in a store, selling what they produce, building thier startup idea (or someone else’s one). Industry in general is on this side of the spectrum.

The programming means used could be anything, from spreadsheets to programming languages (or what tech bros would accept as programming languages because Excel and CSS are not programming 🤬). And again is more about getting the job done than how the job gets done. So not always the focus will be to use state of the art tools. At least not most of the time.

This is in many cases is dictated by what the job is. For many cases spreadsheets are enough, plenty of business run just fine on them. For other jobs you might need different tools, Haskell for example is used a lot in fintech, where the focus on getting things right and correct is at the core of the business.

## Programming as the means on itself

These people are programming for the sake of programming (ie. for fun more than profit), they are doing research on programming, they are developing programming languages, libraries or frameworks to enable others to program. Academia is on this side of the spectrum. A lot of open source is on this side of the spectrum as well.

Spreadsheets are an area of research as. Even by some of the same great minds that research academic languages like Haskell.
