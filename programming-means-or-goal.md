# Programming, means to an end or the end on itself?

I think there are two types of programmers, those that do it as a mean to achieve something else and those that view programming as the end on itself. In reality there are many flavors of that in between. So it’s more of an spectrum than a binary distinction. We can still, however, talk about these two types of programmers.

## Programming as a means to an end

People that only use programming as a tool are usually focused on solving an specific non-programming related problem. Tracking their habits, keeping an inventory of stock in a store, selling what they produce, building thier startup idea (or someone else’s one). Industry in general is on this side of the spectrum. Plenty of startups like to market themselves as technology companies when they _just happen to use technology to solve a problem_, but that's a topic for another discussion.

The programming _means_ used could be anything, from spreadsheets to programming languages (or what tech bros would accept as programming languages because Excel and CSS are not programming 🤬). And again it is more about getting the job done than how the job gets done. So using state of the art tools will not be the goal. Not most of the time at least.

This is in many cases is dictated by what the job is. For many cases spreadsheets are enough, plenty of business run just fine on them. For other jobs you might need different tools, Haskell for example is used a lot in fintech, where the focus on getting things right and correct is at the core of the business.

A great example of this is [remoteok.io](https://remoteok.io)

> [remoteok.io](https://remoteok.io) is a single PHP file called "index.php" generating $101,101 this month. No frameworks. No libraries (except jQuery)💖

The argument here is not that frameworks are bad or that you should use jQuery instead of a modern JS framework. The argument is if you care about the result use the tools that you are more conformtable with, you don't need the last shiny thing everybody is talking about on Twitter.

## Programming as the means on itself

These people are programming for the sake of programming (ie. as much for fun and interest than as for profit), they are doing research on programming, they are developing programming languages, libraries or frameworks to enable others to program. Academia is on this side of the spectrum. A lot of open source is on this side of the spectrum as well.

Spreadsheets are an area of research as. Even by some of the same great minds that research academic languages like Haskell.
